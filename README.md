Automatic twitter message when the internet speed slows down


After saving the personal data and the promised speed of our internet in the secret.py, the script checks the current speed of the internet on the "https://www.speedtest.net/"
webpage. If these data are less (at least one of them) than the promised speed then it automatically logs in to twitter to send a message about the low speed.
